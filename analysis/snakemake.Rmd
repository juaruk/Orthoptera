## Installation & Dependencies

Snakemake was loaded on the cluster using a conda environment as follows
<pre><code> 
module load GCC/11.2.0 OpenMPI/4.1.1 snakemake/6.10.0 Biopython/1.79
</code> </pre>
Snakemake is dependent on the modules listed to be loaded, 
such as GCC, so do not load Snakemake by itself.

## Snakemake Syntax {.tabset}

### Order

A Snakemake file is written in python. The general structure consists of import statements, common directories, followed by rules.

### Rules
Here is the general structure of rules:
<pre><code>
rule myRule:
    input:
       file1 = ...
       file2 = ...
    output:
       fileout1 = ...
       fileout2 = ...
    shell:
       shell commands to make input the output
</pre></code>

You can specify which rules should be run on a local node versus the default of running on the cluster.
These rules should either be a target rule or something very simple, like downloading data. This should be provided before the rules are listed. 

<pre><code>
localrules: all, getHaps
</pre></code>

There also has to be a rule all, this only has an input, which is all of the expected outputs from your snakefile as a whole.

It is important to note that like python, things that are inside the container with a colon are tab delimited. 

### Wildcards
Wildcards in SnakeMake allows for file globbing, so snakemake can find the sample that follows a specific file pattern in a directory. Here is an example. 
<pre><code>
rule aggregate:
    input:
        expand("{dataset}/a.txt", dataset=DATASETS)
    output:
        "aggregated.txt"
    shell:
        ..
</pre></code>
The command expand is needed because in this case we want the input to be a list of all the files that follow the file globbing pattern. 

### Implementation into Slurm Part 1
To implement a snakefile into the slurm, you need a cluster.json file.
Here is a model
<pre><code>
{
    "__default__" :
    {
        "cpus-per-task" : 1,
        "partition" : "medium",
        "ntasks": 1,
        "mem" : "40G",
        "time": "1-00:00:00"
    },
    "trim-adapt":
    {
        "cpus-per-task" : 3,
        "partition" : "long",
        "ntasks": 1,
        "mem" : "100G",
        "time": "2-00:00:00"
    },
}
</pre></code>

Some important things to note is that there needs to be a default. These will be the settings in which every unspecified rule will execute under. Notice that the entire script is encapsulated by curly brackets, and everything inside is tab delimited. 

### Implementation into the Slurm Part 2
Additionally, you will need to create a slurm file. Here is an example
<pre><code>
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=snakemake
#SBATCH --partition=xlong
#SBATCH --time="10-00:00:00"
#SBATCH --mem=20G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

module load GCC/11.2.0 OpenMPI/4.1.1 snakemake/6.10.0 Biopython/1.79

snakemake --latency-wait 3600 --restart-times 1 -j 100 -p --max-jobs-per-second 1 --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster "sbatch -p {cluster.partition} --ntasks {cluster.ntasks} --cpus-per-task {cluster.cpus-per-task} -t {cluster.time} --mem {cluster.mem}" --rerun-incomplete --notemp --nolock 
</pre></code>

Make sure to load the module and all its dependencies within the slurm file.
All of the parameters that start with cluster are specified within the json file created in part 1.
