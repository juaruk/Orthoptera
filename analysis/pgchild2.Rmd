## General
My reference genome is from a female Mormon Cricket, *Anabrus simplex*, located in Idaho, USA. 
I have 34 samples that will be mapped to this reference. 


## MultiQC Report{.tabset}

    Major Conclusions:  
1. Samples MC053 and MC071 may be overrepresented in mapping due to their longer read length in comparison to the others  
2. Samples MC677 may be underrepressented in mapping due to its shorter read length in comparison to others.
