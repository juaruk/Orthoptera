## Introduction
This website provides a detailed documentation on various projects regarding the Orthoptera order of insects.  
  
The first project, **Comparative Genomics of Large Orthoptera Genomes**, aims to compare the sequenced and unannotated genome of *Anabrus simplex* (Mormon cricket) with other Orthoptera genomes and outgroups using TOGA. Additionally, annotated genomes inside Orthoptera will be compared using OrthoFinder. 
  
The second project, **Population Genomics of Large Orthoptera Genomes** aims to finesse the current pipeline for population genomics, and provide accurate analysis for species of interest, including *Anabrus simplex*(Mormon cricket), *Schistocerca piceifrons*(Central American Locust), and Eremidium grasshoppers.
